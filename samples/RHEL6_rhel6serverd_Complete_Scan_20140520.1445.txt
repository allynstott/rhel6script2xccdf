Non-Compliant Checks (138):
1-C1-38476: To ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software packages come from Red Hat (and to connect to the Red Hat Network to receive them if desired), the Red Hat GPG key must properly be installed. To ensure the GPG key is installed, run: rhn_register
1-C1-38497: If an account is configured for password authentication but does not have an assigned password, it may be possible to log into the account without authentication. Remove any instances of the "nullok" option in "/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac" to prevent logins with empty passwords.
1-C1-38614: To explicitly disallow remote login from accounts with empty passwords, add or correct the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config": PermitEmptyPasswords no Any accounts with empty passwords should be disabled immediately, and PAM configuration should prevent users from being able to assign themselves empty passwords.
1-C1-38653: Edit "/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf", remove default community string "public". Upon doing that, restart the SNMP service: 'service snmpd restart'.
1-C1-38666: No path specified. A virus scan program was not found on the system..
1-C1-38668: Configure the system to log a message instead of rebooting the system by altering the "shutdown" line in "/etc/init/control-alt-delete.conf" to read as follows: exec /usr/bin/logger -p security.info "Ctrl-Alt-Delete pressed"
1-C2-38439: Implement an automated system for managing user accounts that minimizes the risk of errors, either intentional or deliberate. If possible, this system should integrate with an existing enterprise user management system, such as, one based Active Directory or Kerberos.
1-C2-38444: :INPUT value in /etc/sysconfig/ip6tables is incorrectly configured.
1-C2-38446: No email address for root found in /etc/aliases.
1-C2-38455: The "/tmp" directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary file storage. Ensure it has its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.
1-C2-38464: The "auditd" service can be configured to take an action when disk space starts to run low. Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Modify the following line, substituting [ACTION] appropriately: 'disk_full_action = [ACTION]' Possible values for [ACTION] are described in the "auditd.conf" man page. These include: "ignore" "syslog" "exec" "suspend" "single" "halt" Set this to "syslog", "exec", "single", or "halt".
1-C2-38468: The "auditd" service can be configured to take an action when disk space starts to run low. Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Modify the following line, substituting [ACTION] appropriately: 'disk_full_action = [ACTION]' Possible values for [ACTION] are described in the "auditd.conf" man page. These include: "ignore" "syslog" "exec" "suspend" "single" "halt" Set this to "syslog", "exec", "single", or "halt".
1-C2-38470: The "auditd" service can be configured to take an action when disk space starts to run low. Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Modify the following line, substituting [ACTION] appropriately. Set this to "email" (instead of the default, which is "suspend") as it is more likely to get prompt attention. V38446 ensures that the email generated through the operation "space_left_action" will be sent to an administrator.
1-C2-38475: To specify password length requirements for new accounts, edit the file "/etc/login.defs" and add or correct the following lines: "PASS_MIN_LEN 14" The DoD requirement is "14". If a program consults "/etc/login.defs" and also another PAM module (such as "pam_cracklib") during a password change operation, then the most restrictive must be satisfied.
1-C2-38477: To specify password minimum age for new accounts, edit the file "/etc/login.defs" and add or correct the following line, replacing [DAYS] appropriately: PASS_MIN_DAYS [DAYS] A value of 1 day is considered sufficient for many environments. The DoD requirement is 1.
1-C2-38479: To specify password maximum age for new accounts, edit the file /etc/login.defs and add or correct the following line, replacing [DAYS] appropriately: PASS_MAX_DAYS [DAYS] The DoD requirement is 60.
1-C2-38484: Update the "PrintLastLog" keyword to "yes" in /etc/ssh/sshd_config: 'PrintLastLog yes' While it is acceptable to remove the keyword entirely since the default action for the SSH daemon is to print the last login date and time, it is preferred to have the value explicitly documented.
1-C2-38486: Implement a process whereby OS data is backed up from the system in accordance with local policies.
1-C2-38488: Implement a process whereby user data is backed up from the system in accordance with local policies.
1-C2-38489: AIDE is not installed.
1-C2-38492: To restrict root logins through the (deprecated) virtual console devices, ensure lines of this form do not appear in "/etc/securetty": vc/1 vc/2 vc/3 vc/4 Note: Virtual console entries are not limited to those listed above. Any lines starting with "vc/" followed by numerals should be removed. (vc/1 vc/2 vc/3 vc/4 vc/5 vc/6 vc/7 vc/8 vc/9 vc/10 vc/11 )
1-C2-38501: fail_interval is incorrectly configured.
1-C2-38513: :INPUT value in /etc/sysconfig/iptables is incorrectly configure.
1-C2-38519: The group-owner of all log files written by "rsyslog" should be root. These log files are determined by the second part of each Rule line in "/etc/rsyslog.conf" and typically all appear in "/var/log". For each log file [LOGFILE] referenced in "/etc/rsyslog.conf", run the following command to inspect the file's group owner: 'ls -l [LOGFILE]' If the owner is not "root", run the following command to correct this: chgrp root [LOGFILE] (2 items found.)

(Use the output from "grub-crypt" as the value of [password-hash]): "password --encrypted [password-hash]"
1-C2-38586: Single-user mode is intended as a system recovery method, providing a single user root access to the system by providing a boot option at startup. By default, no authentication is performed if single-user mode is selected. To require entry of the root password even if the system is started in single-user mode, add or correct the following line in the file "/etc/sysconfig/init": SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin
1-C2-38588: To disable the ability for users to perform interactive startups, edit the file "/etc/sysconfig/init". Add or correct the line: PROMPT=no The "PROMPT" option allows the console user to perform an interactive system startup, in which it is possible to select the set of services which are started on boot.

1-C2-38612: SSH's cryptographic host-based authentication is more secure than ".rhosts" authentication, since hosts are cryptographically authenticated. However, it is not recommended that hosts unilaterally trust one another, even within an organization. To disable host-based authentication, add or correct the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config": HostbasedAuthentication no
1-C2-38613: The root user should never be allowed to log in to a system directly over a network. To disable root login via SSH, add or correct the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config": PermitRootLogin no

(0 unapproved ciphers found.)
1-C2-38623: The file permissions for all log files written by rsyslog should be set to 600, or more restrictive. These log files are determined by the second part of each Rule line in "/etc/rsyslog.conf" and typically all appear in "/var/log". For each log file [LOGFILE] referenced in "/etc/rsyslog.conf", run the following command to inspect the file's permissions: 'ls -l [LOGFILE]' If the permissions are not 600 or more restrictive, run the following command to correct this: 'chmod 0600 [LOGFILE]' (1 items found.)

1-C3-38569: The pam_cracklib module's "ucredit=" parameter controls requirements for usage of uppercase letters in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to contain that many uppercase characters. When set to a positive number, pam_cracklib will grant +1 additional length credit for each uppercase character. Add "ucredit=-1" after pam_cracklib.so to require use of an uppercase character in passwords.
1-C3-38570: The pam_cracklib module's "ocredit=" parameter controls requirements for usage of special (or ``other\'\') characters in a password.

1-C3-38590: To enable console screen locking when in text mode, install the "screen" package: 'yum install screen'.
1-C3-38608: SSH allows administrators to set an idle timeout interval. After this interval has passed, the idle user will be automatically logged out. To set an idle timeout interval, edit the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" as follows: ClientAliveInterval [interval] The timeout [interval] is given in seconds. To have a timeout of 15 minutes, set [interval] to 900. If a shorter timeout has already been set for the login shell, that value will preempt any SSH setting made here. Keep in mind that some processes may stop SSH from correctly detecting that the user is idle.
1-C3-38610: To ensure the SSH idle timeout occurs precisely when the "ClientAliveCountMax" is set, edit "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" as follows: ClientAliveCountMax 0
1-C3-38616: To ensure users are not able to present environment options to the SSH daemon, add or correct the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config": PermitUserEnvironment no

1-C3-38649: To ensure the default umask for users of the C shell is set properly, add or correct the "umask" setting in "/etc/csh.cshrc" to read as follows: umask 077
1-C3-38651: To ensure the default umask for users of the Bash shell is set properly, add or correct the "umask" setting in "/etc/bashrc" to read as follows: umask 077
1-C3-38656: To require samba clients running "smbclient" to use packet signing, add the following to the "[global]" section of the Samba configuration file in "/etc/samba/smb.conf": client signing = mandatory Requiring samba clients such as "smbclient" to use packet signing ensures they can only communicate with servers that support packet signing.
1-C3-38659: Excluding "/boot", 2 mount points are not encrypted. LUKS encryption is required on this system, but is not in use. Refer to https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/sect-Security_Guide-LUKS_Disk_Encryption.html for configuration options.

1-C3-38675: To disable core dumps for all users, add the following line to "/etc/security/limits.conf": * hard core 0
1-C3-38684: Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user can limit risks related to denial of service attacks. This addresses concurrent sessions for a single account and does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple accounts. To set the number of concurrent sessions per user add the following line in "/etc/security/limits.conf": '* hard maxlogins 10' A documented site-defined number may be substituted for 10 in the above.
1-C3-38685: Account expiration missing from the following UIDs above 500: normaluser 
1-C3-38690: Account expiration missing from the following UIDs above 500: normaluser 
1-C3-38692: To specify the number of days after a password expires (which signifies inactivity) until an account is permanently disabled, add or correct the following lines in "/etc/default/useradd", substituting "[NUM_DAYS]" appropriately: 'INACTIVE=[NUM_DAYS]' A value of 35 is recommended. If a password is currently on the verge of expiration, then 35 days remain until the account is automatically disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days, then 95 days could elapse until the account would be automatically disabled. See the "useradd" man page for more information. Determining the inactivity timeout must be done with careful consideration of the length of a "normal" period of inactivity for users in the particular environment. Setting the timeout too low incurs support costs and also has the potential to impact availability of the system to legitimate users.
1-C3-38693: The pam_cracklib module's "maxrepeat" parameter controls requirements for consecutive repeating characters. Edit the "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" file to include the following line prior to the "password include system-auth-ac" line: password required pam_cracklib.so maxrepeat=3
1-C3-38694: INACTIVE value in /etc/default/useradd is incorrectly set to '-1'.
