About
=====
This project is made up of the following:
* rhel6script2xccdf.sh: converts results from rhel6_stig_script into XCCDF XML results to be imported into the DISA STIG Viewer
* id_lookup.txt: a table that maps VUL IDs to RULE IDs
* id_lookup_create.sh: creates the id_lookup.txt file when passed the RHEL6 Manual STIG XCCDF XML file
* samples/RHEL6_rhel6serverd_Complete_Scan_20140520.1445.txt: sample results from the rhel6_stig_script
* samples/RHEL6_rhel6serverd_Complete_Scan_20140520.1445.txt.xml: sample results from the rhel6_stig_script converted into a XCCDF XML using rhel6script2xccdf.sh
